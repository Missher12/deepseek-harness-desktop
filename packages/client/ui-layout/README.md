# @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-layout

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Shell plugin: four-column AppFrame (drag handles and concession chain) plus the `ctx.layout` panel-geometry service; it registers into the runtime-owned `root` slot and declares `sidebar`, `conversation`, `details`, and `conversation.empty`. The Codex-scale sidebar resizes from 264–640 px and remembers its last expanded width; the utility workbench resizes from 420–960 px and starts at 640 px. The sidebar resize boundary is an invisible hit strip, while the details boundary retains its floating pill; only the right surface shrinks during concession and then auto-closes. A closed sidebar retains a 56px control rail while details and utility close to zero width. The package also seats the theme presenter: it consumes resolved `ctx.theme` snapshots and projects them onto the document (`html { color-scheme }` for native UA chrome, `body[data-ds-dark-theme]` from the active color scheme, the theme's alias tokens as inline variables on body, and one owned `<meta name="theme-color">` whose content follows the computed body background). Measuring after palette and token application keeps the rendered background as the single color authority; disposing the presenter removes its metadata node with its other global writes.

AppFrame always mounts the conversation and details columns; a connected Session renders through `SessionProvider`. The layout store persists panel geometry under its own versioned local key, starts the sidebar at 320 px and details closed, and restores the user's last expanded sidebar and utility widths after close or restart. Hero and other unselected states also derive a zero rendered details width without changing that stored preference. AppFrame retains the last non-blank Session id across those states: the first Session remains closed, an explicit details action opens the contract default width, returning to the same Session restores its unchanged width, and selecting a different Session closes details before paint. The conversation owner share is empty, while the sidebar owner share contains only `collapsed` and `width`; registrants obtain business data from standard hooks and actions from their own inject faces.

The `/client` exports are the plugin body (`apply`/`inject`), `LayoutController`, and the four owner-share interfaces. AppFrame, the panel store, and the concession solver remain package-internal.

## Model Experience

None, as the layout shell manages browser viewing state; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Details visibility remains session-sensitive** — switching between distinct Session ids closes details before paint, while persisted sidebar and utility width preferences remain unchanged.
- **Concession-chain auto-close derives a zero width without touching the preferred width** — the panel restores itself when the window widens; consumers must not read the stored details width as the rendered truth.
- **No scroll anchoring during squeeze reflow** — layout changes may move the reader's viewport.
