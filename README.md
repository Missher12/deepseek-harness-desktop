# DeepSeek Harness

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) is an open-source agent harness developed by [DeepSeek AI](https://deepseek.com).

It is built on an **everything-is-a-plugin** architecture and powered by [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis), whose design is described in [_A Programming Paradigm for Spatiotemporal Composability_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.25512).

Documentation: [https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/)

## Unofficial desktop distribution

This community repository preserves the official source and adds an unofficial Intel macOS and Windows x64 desktop application under [`apps/desktop`](apps/desktop/README.md). It is not an official DeepSeek desktop release. The application embeds the existing Harness Web runtime in a native Electron window, owns a random loopback port, and ships the user-supplied whale icon.

Download the DMG or Setup executable from this repository's [Releases](https://github.com/Missher12/deepseek-harness-desktop/releases). The current builds are unsigned; macOS may require **Open** from Finder's context menu on first launch, and Windows may show a SmartScreen prompt.

The local Desktop 0.5.5 build integrates Harness `0.1.3-alpha.1`. It keeps the Project/Session tree, a left turn rail with a 16px inset, responsive transcript width, bounded document attachments and cached usage statistics. The right Workbench, BrowserSkill, Open Design and four bundled companion plugins are excluded from this local product composition. System Update shows separate Desktop and core versions and marks prereleases. This working build is not a published release; local Intel macOS verification does not establish Windows acceptance.

## Developer preview

DeepSeek Harness is in _developer preview_ and iterating rapidly. **THERE WILL BE COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGES.**

Review the [safety notice](SAFETY.md) before running the project.

## Run

### Run from `npm`

Install `Node.js`, then run:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

The command starts the Web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default and opens it in the default browser for a local launch. An SSH launch only prints the host URL because the SSH client or editor owns the local forwarded address. Pass `--no-open` to run the server without opening a browser. See [Web UI guide](docs/user/guide/index.md).

### Run from source

To run from a repository checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness.git
cd deepseek-harness
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm dsh web
```

`pnpm run build` prepares the repository artifacts. `pnpm dsh web` uses those built artifacts without rebuilding.
